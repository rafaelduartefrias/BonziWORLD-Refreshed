# BonziWORLD 2: Remaked (alternatively BonziWORLD 2 Revival/Rewrite)
The BonziWORLD-Two.ga website has been discontinued because Seamus replaced it with his newer websites. This project is made as the only remake, or it is a rewritten version of BonziWORLD 2 (alternatively BonziWORLD - Third Party Edition).

Even though there was a BonziWORLD II website with the domain name: 72.23.210.24:3070, that was the website that was **not** archived at the Wayback Machine because it's the rarely-server to not become shitty.

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run BonziWORLD 2, by all means go ahead.
Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.
